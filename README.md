## [Demo for image processing](https://60fe22f9ff623f0007656040--reverent-hodgkin-dc1f51.netlify.app) | [Demo for tensorflow](https://60ff7e2d10fe590008db70a9--reverent-hodgkin-dc1f51.netlify.app)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/cassidoo/next-netlify-starter).

This project is aimed to demonstrate how to implement a Serverless Functions working with Webassembly in Netlify. The [main branch](https://github.com/second-state/netlify-wasm-runtime/tree/main) showcases an image processing function, and the [tensorflow branch](https://github.com/second-state/netlify-wasm-runtime/tree/tensorflow) showcases an AI inference function. Both written in simple Rust and runs in the [WasmEdge runtime](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge) for WebAssembly.

## Overview

The Serverless Functions endpoint is located at `api/hello.js` to meet the requirement of Netlify, but not to the Next.js. So if you want to develop on you local machine, you should put it into `pages/api/` and make some change.

The only function in `api/hello.js` is grayscaling an image. It receives a png file and pass it as stdin stream to a spawned child process. The child process runs using the [WasmEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge) command.

File `api/functions/image-grayscale/src/main.rs` implements the grayscaling logic. You can build it with the Rust `cargo` command with the `-target wasm32-wasi` option to get the `grayscale.wasm` file.

We define custom build in `api/pre.sh` which is called in package.json to download the [WasmEdge command](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/releases/tag/0.8.2).

## Deploy on Netlify

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Netlify Platform](https://www.netlify.com/with/nextjs/).
